## Neighborhood Map Project

A map of Midtown Manhattan with few interesting places divided in
three categories:
- Attractions,
- Hotels,
- Transportation

To run application go to [my GitHub pages](http://dchernik.github.io).

Filter incorporates auto-complete functionality. To filter by category -
use button (drop-down on mobile) with category name. To show/hide list of
places use hamburger button.

Selecting a place animates its marker and shows information about the place,
with an option to see place's gallery (pulled from Instagram and Flicker).
Also there is an option for Google Maps StreetView of the place.

Current weather conditions are shown for the neighborhood (Midtown). Click
on them to reveal forecast.

and suggested actions.
